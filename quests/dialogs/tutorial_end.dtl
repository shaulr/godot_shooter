zdenka: Ok, I got a rifle from Marko.
Bata: From Marko? He gave it to you?
zdenka: Noooot exactley... I persuaded him to give it to me... Hard... 
Bata: Oh god, no, what did you do?
zdenka: I had no choice, we were talking one moment, the next he was yelling "Die commie loli" and tried to kill me. I had to defend myself. He joined Usta≈°e anyway. 
Bata: Is he dead?
zdenka: No, I don't think so. Didn't stick arround, picked up his rifle and ran.
Bata: Oh, Zdenka. I told you it was dangerous. Anyway, what is done is done. You have a rifle now. You can go on missions. Now let's wait for the morning, for rest of our crew to arrive. Let's see what missions can we give you.
zdenka: Thanks, I am so excited. I am a partisan...
